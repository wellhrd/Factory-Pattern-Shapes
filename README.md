# Factory-Pattern-Shapes

Using the Factory Pattern, this application calculates the area and perimeter of four shapes.

The application should: 

• Ask the user for which shape they would like to calculate the area or perimeter. After which, they 
should be asked to provide the required parameters. 
 
• Instantiate the correct object, do the necessary calculations and print out an appropriate 
message with the results of the calculations.
